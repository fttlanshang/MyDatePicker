# MyDatePicker Component
### Basics
A new component called `MyDatePicker` for react is made based on [antd's DatePicker](https://ant.design/components/date-picker/). Source code is in the `src/MyDatePicker.jsx`. 
When using this component, you can use `<MyDatePicker />`, in this way, days only between today and 2017-08-31 can be selected. If you want to change the end date, you can specify through `date` property, for example,`<MyDatePicker date={new Date('2017-09-31')} />`.

### How to run
1. run `npm install` to install node modules
2. run `npm start` and you will see the result in your browser in `localhost:3000`

Note: This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).
